## About Me:
I am currently studying in FAST university, in my first semester. I had done O levels and A levels before. My experience with programming before has been in Python for A levels and in Java for freelancing/game modding. Out of the concepts I've learnt till now, I really like OOP. I am looking forward to learn C and get really good at it over the course of my University years.

## Programming Interests:
My main interest related to programming is to learn game development. I've been playing decent amount of games and instead of playing normally, usually my mind goes towards what is being done behind the scenes while i enjoy the games, and it fascinates me. I would like to one day make a great game.
